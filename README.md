# PRTG-Sensor-Time-Interval-Editor

## Summary
Edits the time between sensor refreshes in a given instance of PRTG. Logs
which sensors were edited in log files.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
There is no way to mass edit sensor intervals in PRTG, so this script does this
programmatically. Tweaking sensor time intervals can improve performance and
enables further customization of a PRTG instance.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.9.2
- configparser >= 5.0.2
- pandas >= 1.2.2
- pytz >= 2021.1
- requests >= 2.25.1

## Usage
- Add any additional filtering logic to the API URLs to get specific
  sensors if desired.
    - _Make sure you configure filtering options accordingly. Available
      options for filtering can be found on the PRTG API:
      https://www.paessler.com/manuals/prtg/live_multiple_object_property_status#advanced_filtering_

- Add additional logic to fine tune exactly which sensors should be edited in
  PRTG, how many times a connection should be retried, how long to wait before
  a retry occurs, and custom reasons to be logged when the script ends.

- Edit the config.ini file with relevant PRTG access information and the
  timezone for the log file naming.
  
- Make sure the machine running this script has the permission to run an admin-
  privileged PowerShell terminal. This can be done by running the following
  command in an admin PowerShell terminal:
  
  `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
  
- Make sure the PrtgAPI is installed for PowerShell.
    - This can be done by running the following command in an admin PowerShell
      terminal:
  
      `Install-Package PrtgAPI`

    - Make sure that you answer 'Y' to all prompts.\
      
    - Once PrtgAPI is installed, you must downgrade it to version 0.9.14.
      Download this version of 'PrtgAPI.zip'
      [here](https://github.com/lordmilko/PrtgAPI/releases/tag/v0.9.14).
      
    - Once the .zip file is downloaded, unzip it and place its contents into
      the following folder:
      
      `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PrtgAPI\[version number]` or
    
      `C:\Program Files (x86)\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PrtgAPI\[version number]`
    
        - Make sure to check where the PrtgAPI was installed first before editing
          its contents!

- Simply run the script using Python:
  
  `python PRTG-Sensor-Time-Interval-Editor.py`

## Compatibility
Should be able to run on any machine with a Python interpreter. This script
was only tested on a Windows machine running Python 3.9.5.

_Note: There would originally be no need to write a part of the script in 
       PowerShell. However, there is currently a bug in the official PRTG API
       that does not allow us to turn off interval inheritance for a PRTG
       sensor. The workaround is to reference a third-party PRTG API made for
       C# and PowerShell, hence the Switch-Inheritance-Off PowerShell script.
       In the future, this script will be rewritten so that there is no need to
       reference the third-party API so that this script will be cleaner._
